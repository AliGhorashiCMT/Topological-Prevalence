	Pdf files of Fourier lattices with different spacegroup symmetries. The four additional sg 16 and sg 17 examples (denoted Sg16-example-$i or Sg17-example-$i) are the lattices in figure 1 that serve to demonstrate the size of our dataset. Note that the sg16 ones are not in the current version of the paper.
