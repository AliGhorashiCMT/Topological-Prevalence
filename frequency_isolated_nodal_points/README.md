Herein, we investigate the prevalence of nodal points that are frequency isolated 

Lightline.ipynb: Here we check how often isolated Dirac points lie below the lightline

Zoom_in.ipynb: Zoomed in dispersions around Dirac points (calculated with the functionality shown in fourier-lattice-zoom-in.ctl)
