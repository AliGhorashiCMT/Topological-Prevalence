Herein, We calculate full brillouin zone calculations for all cumulatively fragile samples with id_eps = 3 (as a representative sample)
For posterity, these are those samples with input files dim2-sg10-$id-res64-te.sh with $id being one of: 
28159, 27163, 22488, 21548, 27021, 25243, 21152, 23742, 28064, 29229, 20772, 29939, 28545, 20132
